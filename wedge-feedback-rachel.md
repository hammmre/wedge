## Feedback 

I'd recommend replacing the assignment with a fancier README in case you'd like to use this in your job search. 

Based on your submission table, it looks like you've got some errors in your upload. No need to fix those, but I _would_ like you to diagnose them. Pull records by month for both your data and mine and plot them. Let me know if the issue becomes apparent. 

Nice work on this project, you can consider it complete. I'm going to read your files in order and give you feedback
as I move through them, from Task 1 to Task 3. 



### Task 1

* There are clearly some places where this could be made more efficient and I can see you fighting your way through sets of issues to arrive at something that gets the job done. Nice work! 

### Task 2

* Nice job on this task. 
* It'd be worth thinking through how you'd do this the reproducible way. That'd involve selecting distinct card numbers, pulling them down to python, calling `random.sample` and then building a query that could use them all. Let me know if it's not clear how you'd do that. 

### Task 3

* Nice job on this, very efficient. 
* Clever use of the `T` subtype. That probably gets you accurate counts without all the work we did in Intro to SQL.
